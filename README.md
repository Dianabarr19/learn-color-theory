# learn-color-theory

This is a project (of a collection of 77) from the Codecademy's Front-End Engineer career path course. This is a simple static website coded with HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project was to depeen in UI design and choosing the right combination of colors for a better user experience. <br>
There are multiple color schemes to select from:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Monochromatic</li>
<li>Complementary</li>
<li>Analogous</li>
<li>Triadic</li>
</ul>
<br>

<br>

For this project I chose to use a monochromatic scheme design.
